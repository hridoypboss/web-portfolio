        <h3>The Vision: Where Design Meets Logic</h3>
        <p>What started as a personal journey into Graphic Design has now evolved into a mission to build the modern web. I bridge the gap between a blank canvas and a live server. With a solid foundation in HTML, CSS, and JS, and the backend power of PHP, I aim to create websites that don't just work—they inspire. My dream is to be a "Full-Stack Creative" who masters both the look and the logic of every project.</p>

                <p>
                    I started my coding journey in early 2025. Currently, in the final phase of my training, I have gained solid command over **HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and PHP**. My goal is to bridge the gap between complex code and beautiful design to build seamless web experiences.
